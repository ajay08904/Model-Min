  <h1>Model Minority</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Why is the model minority not addressed as much?</h2>
<p>
The model minority is not addressed as much because of the idea that we are the model to the other minorities, and we are not having any problems it is saying to other minority groups if we can be successful; why can't you successful. As Frank Wu said on AJ plus, " It is a way to insult African Americans, Hispanics, and others."  </p>
<hr>
<h2>Who started the model minority, and how does it impact individuals (Asians) and society?</h2>
<p>The start of the Model Minority is said to be a Newyork times article by: William Petersen called "Success Story, Japanese American Style." It says, "Barely more than 20 years after the end of the war-time camps, this is a minority that has risen above even prejudiced critics. By any criterion of good citizenship, the Japanese- Americans are better than any other group in our society, including native-born whites." It first started at just Japenese-Americans but then grew to the whole Asian population as we see today. You can see how this affects Asian individuals on AJ plus when they introduce Belinda Cai, and she talks about the struggle in high school and mental disorders happening to her. For society in total, it aims at other minorities because Model Minority is an insult for other minorities.  </p>
<hr>
<h2>What are we doing to stop or help the model minority?</h2>
<p>
  You can stop or help by spreading awareness about the problem so next time you donâ€™t think that a lot of people do in society about Asians and that it is wrong. </p>
